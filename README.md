## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Leaflet React](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)
- [axios](https://axios-http.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - Deployment

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to call API with axios, add map to your project with Leaflet React, and deploy with Vercel.
Beside that I also learned how to store API token with Vite enviroment config.

### Continued development

The most time-consuming of this project is creating a responsive UI for all type of screen. I believe that the solution I used is not the most efficent one.
